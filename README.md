# LinuxCommands
This is list of some useful Linux commands with their uses. By saying **_Usesful_**, I mean useful for me off course. Actually it's an effort to write down all the commands and their uses which I encountered, encountering and will encounter on my journey through the Linux world!
Why?

Because I suck at memorizing!
And Googling the same old thing is waste of time and effort.

It's solely for my personal purpose. But I thought it would be useful for other peoples too.
Specially people like me! ;)

Anyways, I divided all the commands into two main categories: **No-root** requires no **_root_** or **_superuser_** access; And **Root** which requires it.

* [No-root](no-root.md)
* [Root](root.md)

Most of the commands are pretty much universal but some may only work on **Debian/Ubuntu** based distributions because I mainly use Ubuntu as my daily driver.

Also, I may list some commands that are not built in but you need to install the required package manually.

**_And again, these commands are what I fetch and think are useful to me._**
